# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
For this project, we were provided a Bank's Marketing data. Based on my research on this dataset, the data is related to telemarketing campaigns of a Portugese bank. We seek to predict whether or not the client will subscribe to a term deposit with the bank.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline

### Scikit-learn pipeline architecture

**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
### Data

### Hyperparameter tuning
Hyperparameter tuning along with AutoML can help dramatically speed up the development of models in MS Azure ML. Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that we choose for model training and hyperparameter tuning is finding the best set of parameters to train a model. With the help of packages such as HyperDrive we can automate hyperparameter tuning.

### Classification algorithm

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

MS Azure ML supports the following sampling methods:
1. Random sampling
2. Grid sampling
3. Bayesian sampling

For this project, we used random sampling over the hyperparameter space. In random sampling, hyperparamter values are randomly selected from the defined search space. The benefits of random sampling are:
1. It supports discrete and continuous hyperparameters.
2. It supports early termination of low-performance runs.
3. 

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
