# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
For this project, we were provided a Bank's Marketing data. Based on my research on this dataset, the data is related to telemarketing campaigns of a Portugese bank. We seek to predict whether or not the client will subscribe to a term deposit with the bank.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline

**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

Hyperparameter tuning along with AutoML can help dramatically speed up the development of models in MS Azure ML. Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that we choose for model training and hyperparameter tuning is finding the best set of parameters to train a model. With the help of packages such as HyperDrive we can automate hyperparameter tuning.

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

For this project, we used RandomSampler as the hyperparameter. RandomSample is (define it here). The benefits of RandomSampler are:

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
